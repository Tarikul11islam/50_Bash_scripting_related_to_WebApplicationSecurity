# This is the instruction

Save this script to a file, for example, ` dir_brute.sh ` . Make it executable using the command ` chmod +x dir_brute.sh ` . Then you can run it by providing the target URL and the wordlist as arguments:

```
./dir_brute.sh http://example.com /path/to/wordlist.txt
```
Replace ` http://example.com ` with the target URL and ` /path/to/wordlist.txt ` with the path to your wordlist file.
